               While some aspects of resilience have received attention in
               transport planning, there is no unified definition of resilience
               in transportation. To define resilience in transportation, I
               trace back to the origin of resilience in ecology with a view of
               revealing the essence of resilience thinking and its relevance
               to transport planning. Based on the fundamental concepts of
               engineering resilience and ecological resilience, I define
               ?comprehensive resilience in transportation? as the quality that
               leads to recovery, reliability and sustainability. Observing
               that previous work in resilience analysis in transportation has
               focussed on addressing engineering resilience rather than
               ecological resilience, I conclude that transformability has been
               generally overlooked and needs to be incorporated in the

               However, not all road links equally affect the travel conditions

               the network functioning than the others. It is noted that the

              for mitigating risk to surface road transportation networks. We
              utilize recent developments in modern network theory to introduce
              a novel metric based on system reliability and network
              connectivity to measure resilience-based performance of a road
              transportation network. The formulation of this resilience-based
              performance metric (referred in the paper as WIPW),
              systematically integrates the network topology, redundancy level,
              traffic patterns, structural reliability of network components

               vulnerability of road transport networks. A new technique based
               on fuzzy logic and exhaustive search optimisation is used to
               combine vulnerability attributes with different weights in to a
               single vulnerability index for network links, which may be used
               to measure the impact of disruptive events. The network
               vulnerability index is then calculated using two different
               aggregations: an aggregated vulnerability index based on
               physical characteristics and an aggregated vulnerability index
               based on operational characteristics. The former uses link
               physical properties such as its length and the number of lanes,

               application of the methodology on a synthetic network (based on

  abstract = "The resilience of transportation networks, one of the most
              critical infrastructure in post-disaster situations, will have a
              significant influence on post-disaster operations, community
              resilience and business continuity. Consequently, understanding
              the resilience of transportation networks following a natural
              disaster is crucial. This research proposes a new Trip Resilience
              (TR) measure to assess the resilience of trips on road networks
              following a disaster, integrating all three dimensions of
              resilience, namely robustness, redundancy, and recovery. The
              methodological approach includes an analysis of existing
              transport resilience measures presented in the literature to
              assess their ability to quantify robustness, redundancy and
              recovery in terms of the proposed conceptual model. The
              analytical formulations of the individual component measures are
              then developed, or adapted from previous research, along with a
              means of integrating all three into a combined Trip Resilience
              (TR) measure. A case study methodological approach is then
              adopted to verify the practicality of the proposed measures using
              the outcomes from a transportation simulation of a hypothetical
              Alpine Fault Magnitude 8 (AF8) scenario. A Normalised Trip
              Resilience (NTR) measure is also proposed that converts the TR to
              a normalised scale that is easily understandable to
              decision-makers. Finally, in order to facilitate ranking of the
              post-disaster impact on districts, a new measure, namely the
              Equivalent daily number of Impacted Trips (EIT), is proposed. The
              proposed measure provides an opportunity for decision-makers to
              estimate and rank the trip resilience between each (group of)
              Origin-Destination pair(s) using pre- and post-disaster flow and
              travel time. The resulting measures were capable of being
              calculated from the outputs produced by the transportation
              simulation model in the case study, thereby verifying their
              practicality in real-world situations. The importance of
              including both robustness (represented by the number of
              eliminated trips) and redundancy (represented by increased travel
              time), over the horizon of the post-disaster recovery phase was
              highlighted. Eliminated trips contributed significantly in areas
              that were cut off and isolated post-disaster, due to a lack of
              alternative routes, and increased travel time contributed as more
              roads were reopened but the alternative routes resulted in
              increased travel distances and, consequently, travel time.",

              proxy for dissatisfaction in the new settlements around L'Aquila.

              Previous attempts at quantification of resilience have not

               the physical infrastructure and (2) the socioeconomic context,
               both of which in turn affect (i) how the impact and recovery of
               the physical infrastructure translates into societal impact and
               recovery and (ii) the ability of individuals to recover/adapt
               independently from the recovery of the physical infrastructure.
               The paper suggests that a capability approach may be a suitable
               framework for providing content to the formal concept of
               resilience as a capability approach is especially suitable for
               expressing non-tangible damage that might be caused by natural
               hazards and disasters.",

              on vulnerability and resilience of transport systems. Definitions
              of vulnerability and resilience are formulated and discussed
              together with related concepts. In the increasing and extensive
              literature of transport vulnerability studies, two distinct
              traditions are identified. One tradition with roots in graph
              theory studies the vulnerability of transport networks based on
              their topological properties. The other tradition also represents
              the demand and supply side of the transport systems to allow for
              a more complete assessment of the consequences of disruptions or
              disasters for the users and society. The merits and drawbacks of
              the approaches are discussed. The concept of resilience offers a
              broader socio-technical perspective on the transport system's
              capacity to maintain or quickly recover its function after a
              disruption or a disaster. The transport resilience literature is
              less abundant, especially concerning the post-disaster phases of
              response and recovery. The research on transport system
              vulnerability and resilience is now a mature field with a

              and spatial disparities in diet and diet-related health outcomes.
              However, the extent to which food deserts exist is debated. We
              review the evidence for the existence of food deserts in
              socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. METHODS: We conducted a
              systematic review of primary, quantitative, observational
              studies, published in English or French, that used geographic or
              market-basket approaches in high-income countries. The literature
              search included electronic and hand searches and peer-reviewed
              and grey literature from 1966 through 2007. We also contacted key
              researchers to identify other studies. We analyzed the findings
              and quality of the studies qualitatively. RESULTS: Forty-nine
              studies in 5 countries met inclusion criteria; the amount and
              consistency of the evidence varied by country. These studies were
              a mix of geographic and market-basket approaches, but the
              methodologic quality of studies and completeness of reported
              findings were mixed. We found clear evidence for disparities in
              food access in the United States by income and race. Findings
              from other high-income countries were sparse and equivocal.
              CONCLUSION: This review suggests that food deserts exist in the
              United States, where area-level deprivation compounds individual
              disadvantage. Evidence for the existence of food deserts in other
              high-income nations is weak.",

              posing a threat to human safety, and causing significant
              disruption and associated economic and social impacts. Flooding,
              especially as a result of intense precipitation, is the
              predominant cause of weather-related disruption to the transport
              sector. Existing approaches to assess the disruptive impact of
              flooding on road transport fail to capture the interactions

              locations in the network. The method compares the levels of
              remoteness (or its inverse, accessibility) of localities within
              the study region, on the basis of the impacts of degradation of
              the road network on a recognised accessibility/remoteness index

              It thus extends the earlier work on accessibility-based
              vulnerability analysis which was limited to assessment of impacts
              on selected nodes in a network. The new method allows study of
              impacts on both specified locations (which do not have to be
              represented as network nodes) and the region as a whole. The
              accessibility/remoteness index is defined so that an

              volume under this surface provides an overall measure of

              network. The accessibility level of individual counties and the
              state as a whole is checked before and after the hypothetical
              disruption of individual links within the floodplain. The results

              be different, implying that the priority of retrofit might also

              performance in transportation risk assessment, in addition to
              examining the vulnerability of individual components such as
              bridges, no appropriate measures currently exist. This paper
              develops post-disaster system performance measures and applies
              them to the urban rail and highway transportation systems in the
              Kobe, Japan, region devastated by the 1995 Hyogoken--Nanbu
              earthquake. Performance is evaluated in terms of network coverage
              and transport accessibility. Performance degradation was much
              more severe for highways and railways than for other lifeline
              infrastructure systems. Both transportation systems fared poorly
              in the disaster but service restoration proceeded much more
              rapidly for rail. The restoration of highway system performance
              correlated closely with the recovery of highway traffic volumes.
              The paper further develops a measure of subarea transport
              accessibility and applies this to Kobe's constituent city wards.
              Results indicate substantial spatial disparity that is maintained
              throughout the restoration period. Comparisons with the 1989 Loma
              Prieta and 1994 Northridge earthquakes in the US show that
              although these disasters caused notable damage to highway
              bridges, system performance degradation was small in comparison

               (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis). This has led to increased efforts
               to mitigate the impacts of disruption of road transport
               networks, and the inclusion of changes in network reliability in
               economic appraisals of road network improvement proposals. This

               merits of alternative measures of reliability and models for
               predicting reliability. Methods for assessing and mitigating the

              various types of disruptive events. With growing costs of service
              failure, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the
              dynamic operability characteristics, i.e., the dynamic
              resilience, of road networks. However, existing studies in this
              field generally considered a one-time disaster event during a
              relatively short period, and thus became insufficient for
              assessing the resilience of road networks in an extreme

              validate the proposed TIDRAF. Based on the results of the

              expedite the recovery of the infrastructure network after an

              spread degradations, the analysis method is an important
              complement to the existing studies of single link failures. The
              methodology involves covering the study area with grids of
              uniformly shaped and sized cells, where each cell represents the
              extent of an event disrupting any intersecting links. We apply
              the approach to the Swedish road network using travel demand and
              network data from the Swedish national transport modelling system
              Sampers. The study shows that the impacts of area-covering
              disruptions are largely determined by the level of internal,
              outbound and inbound travel demand of the affected area itself.
              This is unlike single link failures, where the link flow and the
              redundancy in the surrounding network determine the impacts. As a
              result, the vulnerability to spatially spread events shows a
              markedly different geographical distribution. These findings,

               nowadays one of the key factors that impacts the quality of
               urban live. That being said, accessibility is a complex concept,
               which although in common use, has a range of meanings, and
               measuring it raises numerous methodological problems. For
               instance, accessibility is closely related to the concept of
               distance, but as a society evolves, other factors such as travel
               time, economic cost, different transport options, interest or
               attraction of the destination come into play, as well as the
               personal preference of each individual. Several methods for
               measuring accessibility are recognized among researchers and
               urban planning professionals. They can be classified into
               several categories, such as spatial separation measures,
               cumulative-opportunity measures, gravity measures, utility
               measures and time-space measures. In this study, the physical
               distance between urban residents and urban facilities and public
               services is measured. This can be done by measuring distance in
               three ways: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Network. The distance from
               the cadastral built plots (origin) to different urban facilities
               and public services (destination) is calculated. Destinations
               include educational centres, sports facilities, transportation
               system stops, libraries, health centres, hospitals, chemist?s
               shop and green areas. The three results are compared to identify
               and quantify correlations. Depending on the method used to
               calculate the distance between a give origin and destination,
               there may be a population underestimation or overestimation,
               which needs to be assessed. The data were obtained from a range
               of sources: National Institute of Statistics to obtain the
               number of residents; Cadastral online registry to access data on
               the location of buildings; and the National Geographic Institute
               and the Valencian Cartographic Institute to locate urban
               facilities and public services. The main results show different
               correlations between the three types of distances. Euclidean
               distances overestimate the population compared to Network and
               Manhattan distances. Network and Manhattan distances offer
               similar results but the Network distance is much accurate and
               represents much better the real distance.",

               methods (e.g., stage--damage functions) to quantify resulting
               damage and losses to the built environment. While such
               approaches have been used extensively by communities, they do
               not enable the propagation of uncertainty into a risk- or
               resilience-informed decision process. In this paper, a method
               that allows the development of building fragility and building
               loss functions is articulated and applied to develop an
               archetype portfolio that can be used to model buildings in a
               typical community. The typical single-variable flood
               vulnerability function, normally based on flood depth, is
               extended to a multi-variate flood vulnerability function, which
               is a function of both flood depth and flood duration, thereby
               creating fragility surfaces. The portfolio presented herein
               consists of 15 building archetypes that can serve to populate a
               community-level model to predict damage and resulting
               functionality from a scenario flood event. The prediction of
               damage and functionality of buildings within a community is the

              resilience in the recovery after the 2016 Kaik{\=o}ura earthquake",
  author   = "Mason, Dougal and Brabhaharan, Pathmanathan",
  abstract = "The Ward to Cheviot section of State Highway 1 is a key lifeline
              transport route that runs through the Kaik{\=o}ura township. It
              is a strategically important link in the national state highway
              network, connecting the North Island via the Wellington-Picton
              ferry to the city of Christchurch in the South Island. Its
              strategic importance and vulnerable location between the
              mountainous Kaik{\=o}ura range and the Pacific Ocean make it a
              critical transportation route in the national transport network.
              The route has been a focus for understanding the resilience of
              transport networks from as far back as 2000, when this section
              was used as a pilot study in early research into transport
              resilience. A further resilience assessment of this section was
              completed as part of a national state highway resilience study in
              mid-2016. Subsequently, the Mw 7.8 Kaik{\=o}ura earthquake struck
              the northeast of the South Island on 14 November 2016, triggering
              thousands of large landslides and causing severe disruption to
              the transport network. The damage and disruption caused by the
              earthquake was comparable to that assessed in pre-earthquake
              studies of the resilience of the state highway. Landslides and
              embankment failures caused the most damage and disruption to the
              transport infrastructure, with the Main North Line railway closed
              for over 9 months and State Highway 1 closed for over a year.
              Post-earthquake landslides and debris flows triggered by storms
              caused additional damage and disruption during the recovery
              phase. Post-earthquake assessment of the corridor resilience was
              carried out to identify measures to enhance resilience as part of
              the recovery works. These measures included realigning the road
              and rail away from the steep hillsides, engineered works to
              reduce the potential for slope failure, and engineered works to
              reduce the potential for inundation of the corridor. The
              resilience assessments also enabled tactical and operational
              measures to be put in place to ensure safety while allowing the
              recovery operations to proceed in the context of enhanced risk
              associated with storm events and potential aftershocks.",

  abstract = "The abstract representation of a transportation system as a
              network of nodes and interconnecting links, whether that system
              involves roadways, railways, sea links, airspace, or intermodal
              combinations, defines a network topology. Among the most common
              in the context of transportation systems are the grid, ring,
              hub-and-spoke, complete, scale-free and small-world networks.
              This paper investigates the role of network topology, and the
              topology's characteristics, in a transportation system's ability
              to cope with disaster. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that
              the topological attributes of a transportation system
              significantly affect its resilience to disaster events.
              Resilience accounts for not only the innate ability of the system
              to absorb externally induced changes, but also cost-effective and
              efficient, adaptive actions that can be taken to preserve or
              restore performance post-event. Comprehensive and systematically
              designed numerical experiments were conducted on 17 network
              structures with some relation to transportation system layout.
              Resilience of these network structures in terms of throughput,
              connectivity or compactness was quantified. Resilience is
              considered with and without the benefits of preparedness and
              recovery actions. The impact of component-level damage on system
              resilience is also investigated. A comprehensive, systematic
              analysis of results from these experiments provides a basis for
              the characterization of highly resilient network topologies and
              conversely identification of network attributes that might lead
              to poorly performing systems.",

               concepts commonly used in assessing the quality of a variety of
               systems. While each can be applied independently when performing
               risk analysis, there is growing interest across multiple
               disciplines in understanding how these concepts can be
               integrated when considering complex adaptive systems, such as
               communities. In this paper, we identify issues related to the
               use of these respective concepts in assessing complex adaptive
               systems, and describe how these issues may produce imbalanced
               results and maladaptive outcomes. We identify five critical
               areas where alignment and integration across concepts can lead
               to improved system assessment. As a result, we introduce a new

              and political uncertainty and risk has captured the attention of
              academics and decision makers across disciplines, sectors, and
              scales. Resilience has become an important goal for cities,
              particularly in the face of climate change. Urban areas house the
              majority of the world's population, and, in addition to
              functioning as nodes of resource consumption and as sites for
              innovation, have become laboratories for resilience, both in
              theory and in practice. This paper reviews the scholarly
              literature on urban resilience and concludes that the term has
              not been well defined. Existing definitions are inconsistent and
              underdeveloped with respect to incorporation of crucial concepts
              found in both resilience theory and urban theory. Based on this
              literature review, and aided by bibliometric analysis, the paper
              identifies six conceptual tensions fundamental to urban
              resilience: (1) definition of `urban'; (2) understanding of
              system equilibrium; (3) positive vs. neutral (or negative)
              conceptualizations of resilience; (4) mechanisms for system
              change; (5) adaptation versus general adaptability; and (6)
              timescale of action. To advance this burgeoning field, more
              conceptual clarity is needed. This paper, therefore, proposes a
              new definition of urban resilience. This definition takes
              explicit positions on these tensions, but remains inclusive and
              flexible enough to enable uptake by, and collaboration among,
              varying disciplines. The paper concludes with a discussion of how
              the definition might serve as a boundary object, with the
              acknowledgement that applying resilience in different contexts
              requires answering: Resilience for whom and to what? When? Where?

              widespread impacts when they lead to the failure of network
              components and ultimately the larger network itself. An important
              consideration in the behavior of a network following disruptive
              events is its resilience, or the ability of the network to
              ``bounce back'' to a desired performance state. Building on the
              extensive reliability engineering literature on measuring
              component importance, or the extent to which individual network
              components contribute to network reliability, this paper provides
              two resilience-based component importance measures. The two
              measures quantify the (i) potential adverse impact on system
              resilience from a disruption affecting link i, and (ii) potential
              positive impact on system resilience when link i cannot be

  abstract  = "AbstractThe resilience of a system is related to its ability to
               withstand stressors, adapt, and rapidly recover from
               disruptions. Two significant challenges of resilience analysis
               are to (1) quantify the resilience associated with a given
               recovery curve; and (2) develop a rigorous mathematical model of
               the recovery process. To quantify resilience, a mathematical
               approach is proposed that systematically describes the recovery
               curve in terms of partial descriptors, called resilience
               metrics. The proposed resilience metrics have simple and clear
               interpretations, and their definitions are general so that they
               can characterize the resilience associated with any recovery
               curve. This paper also introduces a reliability-based definition
               of damage levels which is well-suited for probabilistic
               resilience analysis. For the recovery modeling, a stochastic
               formulation is proposed that models the impact of recovery
               activities and potential disrupting shocks, which could happen
               during the recovery, on the system state. For illustration, the

              to quantify resilience to climate-related hazards for 52 U.S.
              counties along the northern Gulf of Mexico. The RIM model uses
              three elements (exposure, damage, and recovery indicators) to

              within and across the theoretical elements and used this
              information to select a parsimonious group of indicators. Fifth,
              we combined the indicators into composites of Economic
              Development and Social Capital and an additive index of Community

               cohesion. The core of the paper is then devoted to an
               examination of where the contemporary residential neighbourhood
               fits into these wider debates, particularly in relation to the
               interaction between social cohesion and social capital. In this
               context, some of the key debates around the concept of social
               capital are outlined. In moving beyond abstraction, the paper
               also shows how social capital can be broken down into relevant
               domains for policy action at the neighbourhood level and how
               concepts such as social cohesion and social capital can be
               operationalised for research purposes.]",

              analysis for the designed emergency transportation networks in
              Tehran, an earthquake-prone metropolis in a developing country.
              The situation of Tehran is somewhat disheartening as it has
              developed haphazardly with little attention to construction and
              building codes, which leaves structures, transportation routes,
              and residents vulnerable. This paper attempts to demonstrate the
              challenges of trying to develop transportation vulnerability
              analysis in a developing country, especially one as a major
              population center in a geographic area prone to earthquakes.
              After a catastrophic earthquake in a developing country, the
              conventional network analysis methods may not be employed because
              first, the post disaster travel demand can be fundamentally
              altered from the usual daily travel demand and, perhaps, the
              forecast of the trip demand in the highly uncertain condition
              seems impossible. Second, the behavior of passengers may not be
              rational. In line with this idea, a comprehensive study on urban
              seismic disaster prevention and management for the greater Tehran
              is held in this paper. This paper proposes an approach to
              evaluate post-earthquake response and recovery routes by
              identifying redundancy-based isolation measures to find out which
              zones in this city are most susceptible to disruptions of the
              transport system due to a devastating earthquake, and which
              emergency response trips are most vulnerable in the super-chaotic

               a factor analytic approach, 42 variables were reduced to 11
               independent factors that accounted for about 76 percent of the

  abstract  = "Throughout history, communities and civilizations have sought to
               enhance the quality of community life and the well-being of its
               people. However, more recently there has been greater interest
               in attending to the details of community development by
               capitalizing on the improved ability to capture community
               well-being and successes scientifically. That interest invites
               greater attention to the development of indicators that can
               quantify those qualities of life that lead to strong and healthy
               communities. The selection of meaningful indicators is dependent
               upon several factors including a process that stimulates
               meaningful involvement of community stakeholders, but the single
               most important is the identification of an underlying model to
               guide the work. Indicators do not have meaning in themselves.
               For these measures to provide a coherent assessment of the
               community, an integrative approach to understanding what
               constitutes a healthy and strong community in a dynamic
               environment is required. A resilience perspective serves that
               purpose and provides a framework that is broad, neutral, and
               conceptually strong enough to structure development of
               significant sets of indicators. Exemplary community indicator
               processes across the nation, particularly recent efforts in the
               Phoenix, Arizona region, provide evidence supporting the value
               of indicator development for community building.",

              resilience, yet the extant literature is still mired in
              definitional debates, epistemological orientations of
              researchers, and differences in basic approaches to measurement.
              As a consequence, there is little integration across domains and
              disciplines on community resilience assessment, its driving
              forces, and geographic variability. Using US counties as the
              study unit, this paper creates an empirically-based resilience
              metric called the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities
              (BRIC) that is both conceptually and theoretically sound, yet,
              easy enough to compute for use in a policy context. A common set
              of variables were used to measure the inherent resilience of
              counties in the United States according to six different domains
              or capitals as identified in the extant literature -- social,
              economic, housing and infrastructure, institutional, community,
              and environmental. Data were from public and freely accessible
              data sources. Counties in the US Midwest and Great Plains states
              have the most inherent resilience, while counties in the west,
              along the US-Mexico border, and along the Appalachian ridge in
              the east contain the least resilience. Further, it was found that
              inherent resilience is not the opposite of social vulnerability,
              but a distinctly different construct both conceptually and
              empirically. While understanding the overall variability in
              resilience, the BRIC is easily deconstructed to its component
              parts to provide guidance to policy makers on where investments
              in intervention strategies may make a difference in the
              improvement of scores. Such evidence-based research has an
              opportunity to influence public policy focused on disaster risk.",
