# Monte Christchurch
## ENCN493 Research Project: TLO-01
#### *Dai Kiddle, Mitchell Anderson, Tom Logan (Supervisor)*

Developing a framework to evaluate access distributions of cities to essential
services/destinations with imposed natural hazards.

Use current hazard data and Monte Carlo to simulate hazardous events in Christchurch
and assess the change in access by using the EDE.

Simulation determines which roads and destinations are exposed in initiialise_hazard.py and drop_raods.py
it then closes destinations and certain routes based on a two damage state fragility curve process
outlined in the close_destinations.py and drop_roads.py files.
program.py will run this simulation and save results to sql

Running compile_results.py will then format the big nearest_matrix to be ready for plotting
